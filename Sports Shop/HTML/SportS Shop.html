            <h2><i>SPORTS</i></h2>
            <p>Sport is a form of physical activity or game. 
            <br><br>[1] Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. 
            <br>[2] Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. 
            <br>[3] Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. 
           <br>[4] Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

            <h2><i>SPORTSMENSHIP</i></h2>
            <p>Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat. <br><br>

            [1]Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake. <br>[2]The well-known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice, that it is <i>"not that you won or lost but how you played the game"</i>, and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: <i>"The most important thing... is not winning but taking part"</i> are typical expressions of this sentiment</p>

            <h2><i>YOUTH PARTICIPATION</i></h2>
            <p>[1] Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and athletic scholarships. <br> [2] Activists for education and the war on drugs encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation and to fight the illegal drug trade. <br>[3] According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion. <br>[4] These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey. <br>[5] Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching</p>
